# Coding Bootcamp for Software Engineers
App Academy, Full-Stack Curriculum

The repository contains the projects and exercises I completed while enrolled in App Academy's software engineering coding bootcamp.
The numbering of the folders indicates the order in which they were completed. The following sections highlight several noteworthy projects that I found exciting.

## Software Engineering Foundations - Project Highlights
### Inputs and Outputs
- __Hangman Game:-__ Created a hangman game where the user guesses a secret word on the screen. The user is limited to a certain number of wrong guesses and cannot enter a character already attempted.
- __Hotel Project:-__ Created a hotel project that makes use of two classes, the Room class being a subclass of the hotel. Each room has a maximum capacity and a string containing the names of the occupants. A guest may check into a hotel only if there is a vacancy.
### Object Oriented Programming
- __Startup Project:-__ The startup project uses two classes: employee and startup. The startup class has methods for hiring and firing new employees, paying current employees, and closing the startup. The startup class can also acquire another startup by hiring all of its employees and terminating the previous startup.
- __Battleship Game:-__ The classic battle ship game has been recreated with three classes. The board class controls the board's internal operations like attack and rendering. The player class is instructed which ship to attack. The battleship stores the board, player, and remaining guesses.
### Additional Projects
- __Flight Project:-__ The project uses two classes: passenger and flight. The passenger class stores information like name and flight number. Flight class contains information about a flight's characteristics, such as flight number, capacity, and passengers.
- __TicTacToe Game:-__ This project implemented the classic tic tac toe game for two or more humans or computers on a dynamically sized grid. The final version includes four classes: board, game, human player, and computer player.
- __Todo Board Project:-__ This project created a task board for tracking unfinished tasks. Two versions were created: one that manages a single to-do list and another that manages multiple to-do lists with expanded list and item features.

## Ruby - Project Highlights
### Enumerables and Debugging
- __Ghost Game:-__ Created the word ghost game, in which players take turns adding letters to an expanding word fragment in order to avoid completing a valid word. This implementation enables the participation of more than two players.
- __Maze Solver Algorithm:-__ This implementation determines the shortest path from S to E in a maze.
### Reference
- __Memory Puzzle:-__ This project implements a simple memory card match game via the command line. It is divided into five classes: board, card, memory, and human/computer player.

- __Sudoku Game:-__ The sudoku game is implemented here. It has three classes: board, tile, and sudoku.
### Recursion
- __Word Chains:-__ The program connects two words of equal length by creating a word chain. Each word in the chain must be a dictionary word, and each subsequent word must differ by one letter from the preceding word.
### Git
- __Minesweeper Game:-__ The project implements Microsoft's classic minesweeper game. It makes use of three distinct classes: board, game, and tile.
### Data Structures
- __Knights Travails Path Finder:-__ A PolyTreeNode has been implemented. Created a class that determines the shortest path for a chess knight between two starting positions.
- __TicTacToe With Super Computer:-__ Extended the previous tic tac toe game, by including a super computer that can't be beaten at the game.
