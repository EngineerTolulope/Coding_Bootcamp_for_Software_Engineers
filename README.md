# Coding Bootcamp for Software Engineers
App Academy, Full-Stack Curriculum

The repository contains the projects and exercises I completed while enrolled in App Academy's software engineering coding bootcamp.
The numbering of the folders indicates the order in which they were completed.

## Software Engineering Foundations - Project Highlights
- __Hangman Game:-__ Created a hangman game in which a secret word is generated and the user is prompted to make guesses on the screen. The user is limited to a certain number of incorrect guesses and is prohibited from entering a character that has already been attempted.
- __Hotel Project:-__ Created a hotel project that makes use of two classes, the Room class being a subclass of the hotel. Each room has a maximum capacity and a string containing the names of the occupants. A guest may check into a hotel only if there is a vacancy.
- __Startup Project:-__ Two classes are used in the startup project: an employee class and a startup class. The startup class possesses methods for hiring and terminating new employees, paying existing employees on pay day, and closing the startup. Additionally, the startup class possesses methods for acquiring another startup by hiring all of the previous startup's employees and terminating the previous startup.
- __Battleship Game:-__ Three distinct classes have been implemented to recreate the classic battle ship game. The board class is in charge of the board's methods and internal operations, such as attack and rendering. The player class is given instructions regarding which ship to attack by the player. The battle ship is the final class; it stores instances of the board, the player, and the remaining guesses.
- __Flight Project:-__ This project makes use of two classes: passengers and flights. The passenger class stores information about the passenger, such as their name and flight number. The flight class contains information about a flight's characteristics, such as its flight number, capacity, and passengers. 
- __TicTacToe Game:-__ This project implemented the classic tic tac toe game, which can be played by two or more human or computer players on a grid that is dynamically sized. In the final version, four classes are used: a board, a game, a human player, and a computer player.
- __Todo Board Project:-__ This project created a task board for tracking unfinished tasks. Two versions were created: one that manages a single to-do list and another that manages multiple to-do lists with expanded list and item features.
