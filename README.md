# Coding Bootcamp for Software Engineers
App Academy, Full-Stack Curriculum

The repository contains the projects and exercises I completed while enrolled in App Academy's software engineering coding bootcamp.
The numbering of the folders indicates the order in which they were completed.

## Software Engineering Foundations - Project Highlights
- __Hangman Game:-__ Created a hangman game where the user guesses a secret word on the screen. The user is limited to a certain number of wrong guesses and cannot enter a character already attempted.
- __Hotel Project:-__ Created a hotel project that makes use of two classes, the Room class being a subclass of the hotel. Each room has a maximum capacity and a string containing the names of the occupants. A guest may check into a hotel only if there is a vacancy.
- __Startup Project:-__ The startup project uses two classes: employee and startup. The startup class has methods for hiring and firing new employees, paying current employees, and closing the startup. The startup class can also acquire another startup by hiring all of its employees and terminating the previous startup.
- __Battleship Game:-__ The classic battle ship game has been recreated with three classes. The board class controls the board's internal operations like attack and rendering. The player class is instructed which ship to attack. The battleship stores the board, player, and remaining guesses.
- __Flight Project:-__ The project uses two classes: passenger and flight. The passenger class stores information like name and flight number. Flight class contains information about a flight's characteristics, such as flight number, capacity, and passengers.
- __TicTacToe Game:-__ This project implemented the classic tic tac toe game for two or more humans or computers on a dynamically sized grid. The final version includes four classes: board, game, human player, and computer player.
- __Todo Board Project:-__ This project created a task board for tracking unfinished tasks. Two versions were created: one that manages a single to-do list and another that manages multiple to-do lists with expanded list and item features.

## Ruby - Project Highlights
- __Ghost Game:-__ Created the word ghost game, in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, avoiding completing a valid word. This implementation allows us to have more than two players.
